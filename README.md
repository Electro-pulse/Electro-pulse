# Hi there 🙂
I'm Pratheeswar, student who loves learning new things just like everyone else. Currently I am more interested in Hybrid App development. So
- I’m now learning Flutter framework for apps development
- I have done some basic flutter projects like,
  - WhatsApp UI recreation
  - Music Player (Local files)

Soon I will develop more apps progressively as I learn Flutter ✌️You can reach me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratheeswar-m-34a6a0237) .
Have a Nice Day 😉<br>
