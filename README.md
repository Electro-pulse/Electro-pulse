# Hi there 🙂
I'm Pratheeswar, student who loves learning new things just like everyone else. I am more interested in Apps development. So
- I’m currently learning Flutter framework for apps development
- I have recreated UI of WhatsApp as my first project 

Soon I will develop more apps as I learn Flutter progressively ✌️You can reach me through: https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratheeswar-m-34a6a0237
